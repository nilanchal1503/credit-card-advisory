i have used serp api here just because when we deploy the free version of open router it was getting expired , on local host the api was working totally fine, i also tried on different platforms like choreo, streamlit , render was the only last i could land upon , then talking about the api,s except open router i used hugging face, open ai , cohere api but most of them were paid so either open router on local host or serp ai on deploying tho serp is used for webscrapping with cheerio.js .

if stuck at any point click [ reset chat ] 

llm model : 
1. user inputs the ques.
2. ques breaks down to query embeddings
3. it then transfers to api .
4. api does semantic analysis and provides with relevant ans to llm
5. llm used is mistral , then llm takes those ranked results and then converts them into natural language
6. then it gets upon ui

The other way of creating llm can be , trainig your own data set , then data getting broken down to chunks then chunks to embeddings then stroing them to vector db , implementing rag to llm then nlp an dd esired results .

okayy so moving forwrd in this 
the card reccomendation system 

1. developed cards database
2. then card logic
3. then a form on ui
4. then filling form, the entered data gets transferd to the the logic where it drives the right data from db and displays over .

that is it , below this is the redme file and this was just a aprt explained in easy language , i learned  a lot from this project
